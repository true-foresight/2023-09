## The Future of Asbestos and Fossil Fuels 

Let us consider the impact of depreciation of assets owned or operated by, generalized sovereign nation-states, on their capacity to borrow from the labor of yet to be born, or yet to be "legally acquired" workers, in the future. 

Current assets that are presumed to have worthwhile utility as infrastructure, resources, or equity for future generations of workers, is likely to become obsolete towards needing to be deprecated, by the time any so-called future generations of workers come into physical existence as individually recognizable human beings. 

There was a period of time in history, when people addicted to profits form animal fat and oil from whale blubber, thought that their cattle and fishing based industries would outshine the coal industry. They continued to think in that manner, even though natural gas and refined petrochemicals were becoming popular during that time period, within international trade markets. Then there were people who similarly thought that asbestos was a boon for humanity, and that pagers were the best invention in telecommunications, even though miniaturization of composite materials and semiconductors, had already brought about increasingly popular demand for non-asbestos based home insulation materials in the construction industry. And, a similar evolution could also be seen during that time period in the telecommunications industry, due to consumer technologies like mobile phones, which had affordably become much more useful to consumers than pagers. 

These days, the same types of industrial changes recorded during the previous industrial revolutions are being observed yet again, even as ministers from OPEC countries talk about how there isn't going to be a viable alternative to crude oil and natural gas based electrical energy production, in the coming 50 years, even though modular nuclear power plants stationed on a barge, are already a viable thing. The fact is, most OPEC countries are not nuclear fuel exporters, and the hold that countries like Saudi Arabia have on countries in North America, via petroleum based trade, would only be disrupted by new age, modular, electrical energy production and water desalination plants, driven by geothermal, tidal, or nuclear fission and fusion based processes. 

Do you suppose future generations of Americans and Canadians would like to get stuck in "the dumb-days", while using regressive technologies dependent on polluting plastics and fossil fuels? Do you genuinely feel that future generations will consider the use of goods and services from polluting industries, as being "cool and fashionable?" do you think that North Americans will want to remain uncool and unfashionable, upon being left behind by other countries? Especially, if countries other than America and Canada manage to become independent of crude oil and natural gas, in the coming decade, because of their full-scale adoption of renewable and radiological resources for electrical energy production and distribution of drinking water supplies?  

Even in the transportation and construction sectors, imagine a city that uses zero asphalt or bitumen in the coming future, what would that kind of a city look like? Wouldn't it simply look like the ***Neom Project*** from Saudi Arabia? Isn't it intriguing, how even the Saudis have realized that the future of clean, healthy, and productive living for human beings, requires cities to completely get rid of the usage of coal, asphalt, and bitumen? 

Or, do you feel that future generations of people will miss things like asbestos, asphalt, leaded gasoline, and soot; and will also miss working for corporations like Aramco, GasProm, Halliburton, Chevron, Schlumberger, British Petroleum, P&G, and Shell?  

However, it is practically guaranteed that North America and its fossil fuel addicted legislators, will not be able to match the ecological and socio-economic progress and superiority of countries like Norway, especially in the context of building zero-pollution-emitting cities, by Q3-2033. Yes, Norway is also a crude oil exporter like Saudi Arabia, but they too have figured out that devastating their local ecology with continued usage of fossil fuels and non-biodegradable petrochemicals, isn't going to go well for their nation, even if dumping crude oil in other countries for windfall earnings has been their growth strategy thus far. 

However, depriving countries like Norway from a clean and peaceful future, by plunging them into warfare with Russia or China, while forcing them to purchase American armaments, has become the only remaining strategy for America and its vassal states to maintain an "economic and geo-political advantage", over EU member countries. If the EU is agile and wise, it will figure out a way to meet and exceed UN Sustainability Goals, by 2033, without being dragged into oblivion by 'supreme leaders' of America or Britain. 

Now, are Saudi trade relationships going to deepen with America and Canada, just so that North America and its trade partners can remain tragically bogged down in the dark ages of fossil fuel consumption? Yes, most probably yes. 

Even as Saudi Arabia moves towards decoupling from America and divesting in American companies, the fact that Americans </ins>will not be able to</ins> kick their addiction to Saudi crude oil and petrochemicals, is going to lead to the American federal government and military clinging onto Saudi oil supply lines, ever more tightly. Not doing so would jeopardize the functionality of American Pacific and Atlantic fleets, at a time when America's deteriorating relationships with Russia and China, cannot be buffered by non-fossil fuel based industrial outputs and technologies used by the Americas, the UK, Oceania, Africa, most of Asia, and most of Europe. 

Other than governments of China and a few North European countries, there doesn't seem to be anybody else capable of significantly switching over their country's public infrastructure to, zero-emission energy production and distribution technologies, within the coming five to six years. 

As such, do you suppose it is going to be feasible for Saudi Arabia, America, and Britain to actually allow countries like Norway to exit the nexus of fossil fuel based economies, anytime before they themselves manage to do so? 

Also, what are the key insights from your consumer sentiment analysis and international investment research telling you, particularly regarding the value of treasury notes and bonds, issued by countries that are and will remain stuck in the supply-chain network of fossil fuels, during the coming 10, 20, or 30 years?
