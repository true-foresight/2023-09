## Head-Bobble Superposition Theory

If you would like to learn about quantum mechanics and superposition, you only need to understand the South Asian ["head-bobble."](https://youtu.be/EoJ4Bvsq7gQ?si=XE7_cji4IxuX7f6T)

The Indian head-bobble, simultaneously means: yes, no, maybe, I don't know, could you repeat the question. 

So, if you see (observe) a person reply to you with a head-bobble, and consequently you decide that it means a "yes", then it means a yes, *only for you.* However, if you repeatedly think that the head-bobble means "could you repeat the question?", and you keep repeating yourself with your query, then you will arrive at a situation known as the ["halting problem."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) 

The much more interesting situation is when you take the head-bobble gesture to mean, "maybe." This is because, depending on your personal preferences (opto-mechanical settings), you might then choose to decide that - 

a) "maybe" is less than a "hell yeah", implying a, "no."

b) "maybe" is greater than a "no way", implying a, "not at present, but please try again later." 


Note that in the above case, option (b) can also lead to the halting problem.

As such, the interactions between you and a Pakistani or an Indian, might turn out to become entirely probabilistic and nondeterministic in nature, regardless of your actual interests, questions, concerns, or comments.
